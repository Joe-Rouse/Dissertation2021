## What was the project?

My dissertation project was titled 'Visual joint analysis of Covid-19 data and demographic/sustainability data at country levelâ€™. The aim was to create a visualisation dashboard
displaying COVID-19 and sustainability data. I investigated if the sustainability of a country had any effect on their response to the pandemic.
